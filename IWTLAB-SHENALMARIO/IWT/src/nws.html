	<p class = "text1" id = "para">The iPhone joined several competing products in the smartphone market, and critics and fans alike noted that it offered few 
	truly original features. The main appeal of the iPhone was its incorporation of intuitive software and a simplified appealing interface, as well as the 
	capacity to accommodate new user-selected software. More than 100 million applications (or 'apps') were downloaded in the first 60 
	days after Apple opened its online iPhone App Store in 2008, and by January 2010 more than three billion apps had been downloaded from the store.</p>
